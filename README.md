# LPSCTwitter
This small code generates plots that describe the twitter activity at LPSC 2015, held in Houtson, TX in March 2015

#Description

During the last LPSC, the hastag #LPSC2015 was used by the microbloggers to describe everything that was happening during the event.

I found this interesting and decided to do some simple plots that described the activity day by day.

At the end, I posted pictures on Twitter on the overall activity as well as the most trending topics.

#Recommendations

In the file ```tweetAnalysis.py``` you need to add the fields ```consumer_key```, ```consumer_secret```, ```access_token``` and ```access_token_secret```.

You can find those in https://apps.twitter.com/ by generating your own app, I usually just do a dummy app to generate the fields. These access codes are personalized, so that is the reason I'm not putting them in my code.
